# Flyweight Pattern in Python

It focuses on minimizing the number of objects that are required by the program at the run-time.

Basically, it creates a Flyweight object which is shared by multiple contexts. 

It is created in such a fashion that you can not distinguish between an object and a Flyweight Object. 

One important feature of flyweight objects is that they are immutable. This means that they cannot be modified once they have been constructed.
